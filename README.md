##BookMeetups

Bookmeetups is a site that helps you to talk about your favorite books with other people in your area. Add a favorite book to your library, see who else in your area loves that book, and set up a meeting with one of them to talk about it.

####Quick start
To use BookMeetups, first create an account. This requires a username, password, email address and a zip code.

The system requires an email address so that BookMeetups has a way of notifying you when other users initiate a request for meetup with them.  A valid zipcode is also required, as your geographical location is derived from your zipcode; this physical location is used as a point of reference for finding other nearby users for you to meet.


####How to use

#####Account Creation
To begin, create an account by clicking on the "Sign Up" button.  Input the appropriate data into the relevant fields and click on "Sign Up".  If all entered data are valid, your new account will be created.

#####Searching
From the main user screen, search for books that you have read by using the "Search Books" field up on the top left hand corner of the screen.  Input the desired title and then click on the "Search Books" button.  A list of matching results will be returned.

You may then click on "Add to my collection" to add the selected book to your account. If a book is added in error, you may now click on the "Remove from my collection" button in the page to remove the book from your collection.


#####Book Friends
Once books are added to your collection, you may see a list of other nearby users by clicking on the "Home" button on the top navbar. These are the users in your area who have read at least one of the same books as you. Click on their pictures to see their book collections.


#####Meetups
To initiate a meetup with another user, navigate to one of your friend's profiles. Hover your  mouse over the book you want to meet up to discuss and click on the "Meetup" link that pops up. That link will create your meetup and allow you to start sending messages to the other user.

Compose a message to start arranging your meetup. When you send a message, the other user will be notified via email of your request for meetup.


#####Managing Meetups
To view existing Meetup requests, click on the "My Meetups" button in the navbar.  This will allow the user to view a list of all their active meetups.  Click on the "Go To Messages" button to view the details of the meetup and continue dialog with the associated user.


#####Managing Books
To view your current book collection, click on the "My Books" button in the navbar.  This will load a grid view of all books in your collection.  Click on any of these books to load the detail page for that book, where you may remove the book from your collection via the "Remove from my collection" button.

From here you may also see a list of users who have also read the book. They will be grouped into nearby friends and friends outside of your geographic area. Click on any of their portraits to view their detailed information page.


#####Editing User Details
By clicking on the "Home" button of the navbar, and then clicking on the "Edit My Profile" button in the user detail page, you may update your current geographical location by inputting the correct zip code and clicking on the "Update Location" button.

You may also update the distance you are willing to travel to meet new book friends by typing in the distance in miles in the appropriate box and clicking the "Update Location button".

Custom user profile photos may be uploaded here by clicking on the "Add New Profile Pic" button.


#####Logging Out
Click on the "Logout" button in the navbar to log out of the system.
